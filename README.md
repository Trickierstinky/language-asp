# language-asp package

**NOTE: I can no longer dedicate time to maintain this anymore, if someone would like to take this over please feel free.**

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for classic ASP files into Atom.

I have only converted this from the TextMate bundle, and have made no other changes if you feel anything is missing or is needed please feel free to fork and drop me a merge request.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
